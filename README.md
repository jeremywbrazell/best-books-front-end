Conflict Resolution
•	What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Discuss opportunities to share more of the work and then implement

Speak up and discuss how to make changes and make sure that both understand the code and can walk through it all
•	How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
share notes and ask questions when something is unclear
